# Nicolas Kolling Ribas

## MSc student

I am currently pursuing an MSc in Computing focusing on Networking at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). I also hold a BSc in Computer Science.

I am passionate about free software, particularly Linux, and have recently been conducting research involving eBPF. After using it in my undergraduate thesis, I have also developed an interest in Rust lang and actively seek more opportunities to work with it.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolaskribas/) or reach me by email: [nicolaskribas@gmail.com](mailto:nicolaskribas@gmail.com).
